                                <p ALIGN="justify">The real estate sales process can be quite long. It’s not uncommon for a deal to stretch out two months after an offer is accepted. During that time, there’s plenty of opportunity for missed deadlines. As a buyer, make sure you are aware of all major dates and milestones pertaining to your contract. Hiring a competent real estate agent who can help orchestrate the various parties involved will keep your deal on target. With so many moving parts, sometimes missing a deadline is inevitable. If a deadline is tied to a key term of your sales contract, be sure to have a document recorded detailing any changes to the timeline.

If you and the seller cannot get on the same page about concessions, you reserve the option to walk away. However, what if you really love the house? It’s always best to schedule your home inspection as early as possible so that you have additional time to investigate any red flags that crop up.
